 * <p>
 * This package contains utility classes that provide helper methods for common tasks
 * related to plugin management, including:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Plugin operations - {@link com.firefly.core.plugin.util.PluginUtils}</li>
 *   <li>Version comparison and management - {@link com.firefly.core.plugin.util.VersionUtils}</li>
 *   <li>Class loading operations - {@link com.firefly.core.plugin.util.ClassLoaderUtils}</li>
 *   <li>Resource management - {@link com.firefly.core.plugin.util.ResourceUtils}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * These utility classes are designed to be used throughout the plugin manager codebase
 * to reduce code duplication and provide consistent implementations of common functionality.
 * All utility classes in this package are final with private constructors to prevent instantiation,
 * as they only provide static utility methods.
