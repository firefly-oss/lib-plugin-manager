# Introduction to the Firefly Plugin Manager

## What is the Firefly Plugin Manager?

The Firefly Plugin Manager is a comprehensive framework that enables modular extension of the Firefly Core Banking Platform through a flexible plugin architecture. It allows financial institutions to customize and extend platform functionality without modifying the core codebase.

Think of it as an "app store" for your banking platform - just as you can install apps on your smartphone to add new capabilities, you can install plugins on the Firefly Platform to add new banking features or integrate with external services.

## Key Features and Benefits

### Modularity and Extensibility

- **Plug-and-Play Architecture**: Add new functionality without modifying core code
- **Dynamic Loading**: Install, update, and uninstall plugins at runtime
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic resolution of plugin dependencies

### Reactive Design

- **Non-Blocking Operations**: Built on Spring WebFlux and Project Reactor
- **Scalability**: Efficient resource utilization under high load
- **Responsive**: Maintains responsiveness even during intensive operations

### Flexibility

- **Multiple Installation Methods**: Install plugins from JAR files, Git repositories, or classpath
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Plugins communicate through a reactive event bus
- **Configuration Options**: Extensive configuration capabilities for plugins

### Security and Stability

- **Isolated Execution**: Run plugins in isolated environments
- **Configurable Security Boundaries**: Control what plugins can access
- **Health Monitoring**: Track plugin health and resource usage

### Developer Experience

- **Clear Extension Points**: Well-defined interfaces for extending functionality
- **Debugging Support**: Debug plugins at runtime
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and examples

## Technical Foundation

The Firefly Plugin Manager is built on modern technologies:

- **Java 21**: Leverages the latest Java features for improved performance and developer productivity
- **Spring Boot 3.2.2**: Built on the Spring ecosystem for enterprise-grade reliability
- **WebFlux**: Uses reactive programming for efficient resource utilization
- **Project Reactor 3.6.x**: Provides reactive streams implementation
- **Multi-Module Maven Structure**: Organized in a modular structure for better maintainability

## Core Components

The Plugin Manager consists of several key components:

1. **Plugin Registry**: Central repository for all plugins in the system
2. **Extension Registry**: Manages extension points and their implementations
3. **Event Bus**: Enables communication between plugins (in-memory or Kafka)
4. **Plugin Loader**: Handles loading and unloading of plugins
5. **Utility Classes**: Provides common functionality for plugins
